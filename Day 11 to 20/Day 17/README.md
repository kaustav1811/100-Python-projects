📅 Day 17 - Python Quiz Game 🧠

🎯 About the Project :- 

  1. This is a Python-based Quiz Game, where players answer True/False questions. The game:
  2. Randomly selects questions from a predefined dataset (data.py).
  3. Keeps track of the player's score.
  4. Displays whether the answer was correct or not.
  5. Ends when all questions have been answered.

🏗️ How It Works :- 

  1. The game loads questions from data.py, storing them in a Question Bank.
  2. The player is asked True/False questions one by one.
  3. The program checks the answer, updates the score, and provides feedback.
  4. The game continues until all questions are answered.
  5. The final score is displayed at the end.

📂 Project Structure :- 

  1. main.py → Runs the quiz game logic.
  2. brain.py → Manages question flow and scoring.
  3. question_model.py → Defines the question structure.
  4. data.py → Contains multiple question sets.

🚀 Future Improvements

  ✅ Level-based System → Introduce difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

  ✅ Score Threshold for Progression → Players must answer X out of 10 correctly to move to the next level.

  ✅ Multiple Question Types → Instead of only True/False, add MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions).

  ✅ Randomized Question Selection → Instead of using only Question_data1, randomly select from multiple datasets (Question_data1 to Question_data14).

🔥 What I Learned:- 

  1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for structuring the game.
  2. Working with lists & dictionaries for data storage.
  3. Looping & Conditional Statements to control game flow.
  4. Handling User Input dynamically.

📅 Day 5 - Random Password Generator 🔐

🔑 About the Project -
This Python script generates a random password based on user preferences. The user can specify:
  1. The number of letters, numbers, and symbols in the password.
  2. Whether they want an easy-level (ordered) or hard-level (shuffled) password.
  3. A strong and secure password is then generated and displayed.

🔥 What I Learned :-

  1. Using random.choice() to select random characters from a list.
  2. Working with lists and appending elements dynamically.
  3. Implementing random.shuffle() to enhance password security.
  4. Taking and processing user input for a customized experience.

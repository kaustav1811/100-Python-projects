ðŸ“… Day 7 - Hangman Game ðŸŽ­

ðŸ”¤ About the Project - This is a Hangman Game built in Python where players try to guess a randomly chosen word before running out of lives. 

The game includes:

  1. A predefined word list (word_list.py) with various categories.
  2. ASCII art (art.py) that visually represents the hangman stages.
  3. A game loop (hangman_game.py) that tracks correct guesses, displays progress, and manages lives.

ðŸŽ® How It Works :- 

  1. The program picks a random word from the word list.
  2. The player guesses one letter at a time.
  3. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word; wrong guesses reduce lives.
  4. ASCII art updates with every incorrect guess.
  5. The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of lives.

ðŸ”¥ What I Learned :- 
  1. Working with modules by importing functions and lists from different files.
  2. Using random.choice() to pick words dynamically.
  3. Managing lists and strings to track guessed letters.
  4. Implementing game loops with conditions to control flow.
  5. Using ASCII art for a more interactive gaming experience.

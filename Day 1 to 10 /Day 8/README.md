📅 Day 8 - Caesar Cipher 🔐

🏛️ About the Project - This project implements the Caesar Cipher, an ancient encryption technique that shifts letters in a message by a specified number of places in the alphabet. 

The program allows users to:

  1. Encode a message by shifting letters forward.
  2. Decode a message by shifting letters backward.
  3. Handle non-alphabet characters without altering them.
  4. Repeat the process until the user decides to exit.

🔠 How It Works:- 
  1. The user selects whether they want to encode or decode a message.
  2. They input their message and a shift number.
  3. The program applies the shift to each letter and returns the transformed message.
  4. The user can choose to repeat or exit.

🔥 What I Learned :- 
  1. Using lists and indexing to shift letters.
  2. Implementing modulo arithmetic for wrap-around letter shifts.
  3. Managing loops to allow continuous encryption/decryption.
  4. Handling user input dynamically to improve interaction.

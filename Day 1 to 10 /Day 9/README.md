📅 Day 9 - Silent Auction 🎭

🏆 About the Project - This is a Silent Auction Program where multiple bidders can enter their names and bids without seeing others' bids. 

The program:

  1. Accepts multiple bids, passing the computer to each bidder.
  2. Clears the screen after each entry to maintain secrecy.
  3. Determines the highest bidder and announces only their name and winning bid.

💰 How It Works :- 

  1. The program displays an auction logo and welcomes users.
  2. Each bidder enters their name and bid amount.
  3. The program asks if there are more bidders and clears the screen before the next entry.
  4. Once bidding ends, the highest bid is determined, and the winner is announced.

🔥 What I Learned :- 
  1. Using dictionaries to store and manage multiple bids.
  2. Implementing loops for continuous user input.
  3. Using os.system('cls') to clear the screen (for Windows).
  4. Extracting the maximum value from a dictionary to find the winner.
